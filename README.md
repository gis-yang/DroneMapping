## Course description
This training course is design to teach our partners in the NSF eelgrass drone mapping project. The UCF portion of the project uses Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), i.e. drones, to measure eelgrass meadow extent, patchiness, and dynamics through time. Drone imagery will be collected at least annually in coordination with in situ sampling which will also be used to validate the imagery by ground-truthing across a range of points within each meadow. We create this training course for our eelgrass mapping friends to learn how to fly drone for collecting data, and perform the data analysis in Geographical Information Science (GIS) method. This training course contains topics of flying DJI drones, Preflight & Planning, FAA part 107 examination, Drone2map user guide, and ArcGIS based drone image analyses.

## Course Objectives   
1.	Basic knowledge of Drone, setup and maintenance. 
2.	Learn how to fly drone, manual manipulation and auto-pilot.
3.	Learn FAA regulation, sectional chart, and how to take the part 107 exam.
4.	Safety guidlines when flying drone. 
5.	Learn to use DJI GS Pro for auto-pilot flying and collecting field data. 
6.	In situ measurements guide, collecting field data and Ground Control Points (GCPs).
7.	Use Esri Drone2Map to stitching and geo-referencing the drone imagery. 
8.	Data management and cloud storage of drone imagery
9.	Basic GIS analysis on drone imagery, digitizing, multi-spectral band math, vegetation index and image classification. 
Course outline:
###	[Introduction to flying drone](/Documents/CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_and_Safety.pdf)
*	20 minutes lecture to drone and basic manipulation.
*	Read the “Phantom 4 user manual” in the course material and setup the drone.
*	1.5-hour practice fly with the help of TA, get familiar with drone manipulating, fly around and taking picture/video using the drone.

### [Advance drone flying](/Documents/CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_Document.pdf)
*	Read the “CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_Document” in the course material, learn to use DJI GS Pro app for auto-pilot and safety guidelines. 
*	2-hour practice flying via auto-pilot with the help of TA, collecting images for mapping, and transfer all images from drone to computer.

### [Processing the drone imagery to mapping products](/Documents/CSGIS_Drone2map_User_Guide.pdf)

*	Learn the “CSGIS_Drone2map User Guide”.
*	1-hour lab session for drone2Map data processing.
Note: Drone2Map software package could be downloaded from course material resources folder. Sample data are provided in course folder.

### [Drone imagery and eelgrass mapping principles](/Slides/UAV_Traning_Slides_Yang.pptx)
*	40 minutes lecture for drone eelgrass mapping principles. 
*	30 minutes discussion followed by the lecture to discuss eelgrass drone mapping. 

### [Data analysis in Geographical Information Science (GIS)](/Documents/CSGIS_ArcGIS_based_Image_Analyses_Manual.pdf)
*	Learn the “CSGIS_ ArcGIS based Image Analyses Manual”
*	1-hour lab session for GIS analysis on drone imagery, digitizing, multi-spectral band math, vegetation index and image classification.
Note: ArcMap software package could be downloaded from course material resources folder. Sample data are provided in course folder.

###	[Self-study for FAA part 107 exam](/Documents/CSGIS_Instruction_for_FAA_Part_107_Examination.pdf)
*	10-hours study for “CSGIS_Instruction for FAA Part 107 Examination” as well as “remote_pilot_study_guide” for taking the exam. There are also lots of resources online.
